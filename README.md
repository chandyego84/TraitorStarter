## CptS 122: Project Assignment 9
**Background:** This project is my first time using the Unreal Engine. My plan was to create a 3D version of "Among Us" with some extra functionality/style of my own added to it,
but I realized that will take more time than I have for this assignment. After spending days reading guides/forums/documentation and watching tutorials/how-tos, I've decided
to simplify my game idea and hopefully build on it for the "Among Us"-based game I originally had in mind. 

### Game Concept:

You are to go against another player in a Capture the Flag game, and you each have a gun but with just one bullet. The players can use the pistol anytime during a round, and if
they hit the opposing player their speed will slow down--a headshot is an instant kill/win. 

# TODOs (post-semester):
